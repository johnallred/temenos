  * O God, 
    * the Eternal Father, 
  * we ask thee 
    * in the name of thy Son, Jesus Christ, 
  * to bless and sanctify this bread 
     * to the souls of all those who partake of it; 
  * that they may 
    * eat in remembrance of the body of thy Son, 
    * and 
    * witness unto thee, O God, the Eternal Father, 
  * that they are willing to 
    * take upon them the name of thy Son, 
    * and 
    * always remember him, 
    * and 
    * keep his commandments which he hath given them, 
  * that they may 
    * always have his Spirit to be with them. 
  * Amen.
